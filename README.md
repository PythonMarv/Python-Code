# Population Flow Diagram
A population flow diagram was created to visualize customer segmentation.

## Data Consistency and Wrangling
Python was used for data consistency and wrangling steps. Columns were derived as necessary to support analysis.

## Analysis
Exploratory analysis was performed to answer key questions provided by the sales team. Insights were derived from the data.

## Visualizations
Various visualizations were generated using Python libraries such as Seaborn and Matplotlib to illustrate patterns and trends in the data.

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis, recommendations were formulated and sent to the client. These recommendations include strategies for segmentation, scheduling ads, and directing marketing efforts.

## Objective
Instacart requested an initial data and exploratory analysis to uncover sales patterns and derive insights for better segmentation.

### Key Questions
1. Identify busiest days and hours for scheduling ads.
2. Determine peak spending times for targeted product advertising.
3. Simplify price range groupings for marketing and sales efforts.
4. Identify popular product types and departments.
5. Analyze customer behavior based on loyalty, region, age, family status, and demographic information.

## Data
Datasets used:
- Customers
- Orders
- Orders_products_prior
- Products
- Departments

## Tools
Python was used for analysis with the following libraries:
- Pandas: data analysis
- Numpy: mathematical equations
- Seaborn: data visualizations
- Matplotlib: data visualizations
